  I want to see movies matching only certain MPAA ratings

  Background: movies have been added to database # features/filter_movie_list.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist:            # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:3
      | title                   | rating | release_date |
      | Aladdin                 | G      | 25-Nov-1992  |
      | The Terminator          | R      | 26-Oct-1984  |
      | When Harry Met Sally    | R      | 21-Jul-1989  |
      | The Help                | PG-13  | 10-Aug-2011  |
      | Chocolat                | PG-13  | 5-Jan-2001   |
      | Amelie                  | R      | 25-Apr-2001  |
      | 2001: A Space Odyssey   | G      | 6-Apr-1968   |
      | The Incredibles         | PG     | 5-Nov-2004   |
      | Raiders of the Lost Ark | PG     | 12-Jun-1981  |
      | Chicken Run             | G      | 21-Jun-2000  |
    And I am on the RottenPotatoes home page     # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
DEPRECATION: Using `should` from rspec-expectations' old `:should` syntax without explicitly enabling the syntax is deprecated. Use the new `:expect` syntax or explicitly enable `:should` with `config.expect_with(:rspec) { |c| c.syntax = :should }` instead. Called from /home/ec2-user/environment/hw-bdd-cucumber/rottenpotatoes/features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:12:in `block in <top (required)>'.
    Then 10 seed movies should exist             # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:11

  Scenario: restrict to movies with 'PG' or 'R' ratings # features/filter_movie_list.feature:25
      # enter step(s) to check the 'PG' and 'R' checkboxes
      # enter step(s) to uncheck all other checkboxes
      # enter step to "submit" the search form on the homepage
      # enter step(s) to ensure that PG and R movies are visible
      # enter step(s) to ensure that other movies are not visible
    Given I am on the RottenPotatoes homepage           # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
    When I check the following ratings: R, PG           # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:28
    And I uncheck the following ratings: PG-13, G       # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:28
    And I press "Refresh"                               # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52
    Then I should see "The Terminator"                  # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105
    And I should see "When Harry Met Sally"             # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105
